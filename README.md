**Privacy Graph: Privacy-Preserving Spectral Analysis of Encrypted Graphs in the Cloud**

**Project Overview**

This project applies privacy-preserving spectral analysis on encrypted healthcare graphs using edge and cloud computing. It focuses on handling sensitive healthcare data, such as patient-doctor interactions, through fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and secure machine learning (ML) techniques. The project demonstrates how to securely process, analyze, and extract insights from encrypted graph data in the cloud.

**Repository Contents**

*   **privacy-graph.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook that outlines the data preparation, encryption, and spectral analysis steps, along with ML model applications.

**Project Workflow**

1.  **Data Preparation (Edge)**
    
    *   Dataset includes healthcare graph data, such as patient-doctor interactions.
        
    *   Construct the graph by representing entities (patients, doctors, treatments) as nodes and relationships as edges.
        
    *   Clean and pre-process the graph to remove inconsistencies.
        
2.  **Edge Processing (Pre-computation)**
    
    *   **Local Encryption**: Encrypt the graph using FHE with libraries like Microsoft SEAL, PyCryptodome, or HElib.
        
    *   **Feature Extraction**: Perform basic processing tasks, such as dimensionality reduction or anomaly detection.
        
    *   **Edge-Cloud Communication**: Securely transmit encrypted data to the cloud using protocols like SSL/TLS.
        
3.  **Cloud Processing (Spectral Analysis & ML)**
    
    *   **Privacy-Preserving Spectral Analysis**: Conduct spectral analysis (e.g., eigenvalue decomposition, community detection) directly on encrypted data.
        
    *   **Graph ML Models**: Apply models like Graph Neural Networks for insights on encrypted data, predicting outcomes or identifying patterns.
        
    *   **Optimization**: Optimize the cloud computation and minimize communication overhead.
        
4.  **Security & Privacy Enforcement**
    
    *   Conduct security checks, simulate potential attacks, and verify data protection.
        
    *   Use formal methods to ensure privacy guarantees.
        
5.  **Performance Evaluation**
    
    *   Benchmark the system's performance, including encryption time, spectral analysis speed, and model accuracy.
        
    *   Evaluate scalability for larger healthcare graphs.
        
6.  **Final Integration and Results**
    
    *   Integrate the edge pre-processing, encryption, and cloud-based spectral analysis.
        
    *   Document the workflow, techniques, and results, emphasizing the novel application of spectral analysis to secure healthcare data.
